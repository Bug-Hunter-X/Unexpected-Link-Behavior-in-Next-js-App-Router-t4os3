# Next.js 13 App Router Link Component Issue

This repository demonstrates a potential issue with the `next/link` component within the Next.js 13 App Router.  The issue occurs when using the Link component in a way that may conflict with the new App Router's client-side navigation and server-side rendering paradigms. The solution provides an alternative approach that adapts to the new router's behavior and ensures proper routing and data fetching.

## Problem

In the App Router, client-side navigation is handled differently compared to the Pages Router. This may lead to unexpected behavior with `next/link` if not properly configured.

## Solution

The provided solution modifies the `next/link` implementation to account for these changes.  The solution may involve additional checks for the client-side environment, adjustments to routing logic, or using an alternative approach for client-side navigation.
